# Bug audit — Runestone text engine

**Scope:** `/Users/alex/Developer/Runestone` (library, not a host app).  
**Platform:** macOS 12+ (package), AppKit custom `TextView` (not SwiftUI `TextEditor` / `NSTextView`).  
**Language:** Swift 6 (`swiftLanguageMode(.v6)`), no `defaultIsolation: MainActor`.  
**Pass:** read-only. No code was changed.

Text lives in `StringView` (contiguous `NSMutableString` or file-backed `PieceTree`). Mutations funnel through `TextInputView.replaceText`. Undo is `TimedUndoManager`. Load is `DocumentLoader`/`TextViewState.load` (UTF-8 mmap). There is no library save path.

### [P0] File-backed documents materialize the entire buffer on ordinary input-system queries

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/StringView.swift:45-53, Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift:99-107, 1984, 2044-2047, 1028, Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextView.swift:2108-2116  
Symptom: Opening a large UTF-8 file via `TextViewState.load` / `WorkbenchDocument.load` then moving the caret, backspacing, selecting all, or opening Find spikes memory to a full UTF-16 copy of the file and can hang the main thread. A 50 MB file becomes ~100 MB of UTF-16 on every `endOfDocument` query; a 500 MB file can freeze or jetsam.  
Repro:

1. `let state = try await TextViewState.load(contentsOf: url)` on a 50+ MB UTF-8 file.
2. `textView.setState(state)`.
3. Click in the view (AppKit queries `endOfDocument` / `hasText`) or press Delete, or ⌘F.

Cause: `StringView.string` documents that it allocates the whole file, and `PieceTree.materializeNSString()` copies every UTF-16 unit. `TextInputView` still uses that getter for length and grapheme walks even though `stringView.length` and `stringView.rangeOfComposedCharacterSequence(at:)` exist:

```99:107:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift
    var endOfDocument: UITextPosition {
        IndexedPosition(index: string.length)
    }
    // ...
    var hasText: Bool {
        string.length > 0
    }
```

```1984:1985:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift
            let characterRange = string.customRangeOfComposedCharacterSequence(at: currentSelection.location - 1)
```

Find does the same: `textForFind` is `textInputView.string as String`.  
Fix: Route `endOfDocument`, `hasText`, `selectAll`, delete, and find through `stringView.length` / `stringView.rangeOfComposedCharacterSequence` / a ranged reader. Never call `stringView.string` on the file-backed path except for an explicit full export.  
Risk if unfixed: hang / memory exhaustion on the mmap path that load was built to avoid.

### [P0] Preview-tab reuse drops unsaved edits and file-backed content

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/Workbench/EditorPane.swift:80-95, Sources/Runestone/Workbench/WorkbenchDocument.swift:14, 44  
Symptom: Clicking a second file into a preview (temporary) tab silently discards the first file's buffer. If the user had typed in the preview tab, those edits disappear with no prompt. If the first document was loaded with `WorkbenchDocument.load`, the replacement tab is empty (`text == ""`) and has no `pendingState` / piece tree.  
Repro:

1. `let a = try await WorkbenchDocument.load(contentsOf: fileA)`.
2. `pane.openDocument(a, asTemporary: true)` and apply `pendingState` to a `TextView`; type "hello".
3. `pane.openDocument(try await WorkbenchDocument.load(contentsOf: fileB), asTemporary: true)`.
4. Tab count stays 1; "hello" is gone; `selectedDocument.text` is `""`; `pendingState` / `isFileBacked` / `rangeReader` were never copied onto the reused slot.

Cause: `isDirty` is stored but never set `true` on edit (only initialized `false` and forced `false` on reuse). The reuse condition `!documents[index].isDirty` is therefore always true. The copy list omits the fields that actually hold a loaded file:

```80:92:Sources/Runestone/Workbench/EditorPane.swift
        if asTemporary,
           let tempID = temporaryDocumentID,
           let index = documents.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == tempID }),
           !documents[index].isDirty {
            let slot = documents[index]
            slot.url = document.url
            slot.displayName = document.displayName
            slot.text = document.text
            // pendingState, isFileBacked, rangeReader not copied
            slot.isDirty = false
```

`WorkbenchDocumentSnapshot` has the same hole: it serializes `document.text`, which load leaves as `""`.  
Fix: Set `isDirty = true` from the workbench adapter on `textViewDidChange`. On preview reuse, copy `pendingState`, `isFileBacked`, and `rangeReader` (or replace the slot object). Refuse reuse when dirty. Restore sessions from `url` + reload, not from empty `text`.  
Risk if unfixed: data loss.

### [P0] Regex replace crashes on an unmatched optional capture

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/ParsedReplacementString.swift:53-55  
Symptom: Replace All (find panel, regex on) with a pattern that has an unmatched alternative group raises `NSRangeException` and takes down the process.  
Repro:

1. Document text: `b`.
2. Find regex `(a)|(b)`, replace `$1$2`.
3. Replace All.

`NSRegularExpression` still reports `numberOfRanges == 3`. Group 1 did not participate, so `range(at: 1)` is `{NSNotFound, 0}`. The code only checks the index, then calls `substring(with:)`:

```53:55:Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/ParsedReplacementString.swift
                if parameters.index < textCheckingResult.numberOfRanges {
                    let range = textCheckingResult.range(at: parameters.index)
                    let substring = string.substring(with: range)
```

`testPlaceholderThatIsOutOfBounds` covers `$2` when there is no group 2, not `{NSNotFound, 0}` for a group that exists but did not match.  
Fix: If `range.location == NSNotFound`, treat the capture as `""` (VS Code / ICU). Do not call `substring(with:)`.  
Risk if unfixed: crash on a normal regex replace.

### [P0] Undo during IME composition leaves a stale marked range and the next keystroke crashes

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift:2794-2814, 2282-2284; Sources/Runestone/Library/TextEditHelper.swift:27  
Symptom: Compose a character (backtick dead key, Japanese/Korean candidate, or any `setMarkedText`), Undo, then continue composing or press Return. Crash: `Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional` in `TextEditHelper.replaceText` (`linePosition(at:)!`).  
Repro:

1. Empty document. Press `` ` `` so the editor has marked text `{0,1}`.
2. Cmd+Z. Buffer is empty. `unmarkText()` is not called, so `imeMarkedRange` is still `{0,1}`.
3. Input method sends `setMarkedText(nil)` or another candidate. `applyMarkedText` reuses `{0,1}`.
4. `linePosition(at: 1)!` with document length 0.

Cause: undo of `replaceText` restores the old string and selection but never clears `imeMarkedRange`. The next `setMarkedText` prefers that stale range over the (now empty) selection:

```2794:2803:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift
    private func applyMarkedText(_ markedText: String?, selectedRange markedSelectedRange: NSRange) {
        guard let range = imeMarkedRange ?? self.selection else {
            return
        }
        // ...
        replaceText(in: range, with: markedText)
```

```27:27:Sources/Runestone/Library/TextEditHelper.swift
        let oldEndLinePosition = lineManager.linePosition(at: range.location + range.length)!
```

`packed.row(containingUTF16:)` returns nil when `location > length`.  
Fix: Clear `imeMarkedRange` (and tell the input context to unmark) in the undo closure, and clamp/guard `linePosition` instead of force-unwrapping.  
Risk if unfixed: crash during everyday IME / dead-key use.

### [P1] Full-line indent/outdent also mutates the following line

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/LineManager/LineManager.swift:319-343, Sources/Runestone/TextView/Indent/IndentController.swift:53-54, 92-93  
Symptom: Select a whole line (triple-click, or drag through the trailing newline) and press Tab / ⌘]. The next line is indented too. Move-line and fold/highlight queries that use `lines(in:)` have the same extra row.  
Repro:

1. Buffer `foo\nbar`.
2. Select `{0,4}` (the first line including `\n`).
3. `shiftRight`. Both `foo` and `bar` gain indent.

Cause: `NSRange` is half-open, but `lines(in:)` and `startAndEndLine(in:)` look up `location + length` as if it were a character in the selection:

```319:324:Sources/Runestone/LineManager/LineManager.swift
    func lines(in range: NSRange) -> [DocumentLineNode] {
        guard let firstLine = line(containingCharacterAt: range.location) else {
            return []
        }
        var lines: [DocumentLineNode] = [firstLine]
        if range.length > 0, let lastLine = line(containingCharacterAt: range.location + range.length), lastLine !== firstLine {
```

For `{0,4}` the last character is at 3 (`\n` of line 0). Offset 4 is the `b` of line 1.  
Fix: Use `line(containingCharacterAt: range.location + range.length - 1)` when `length > 0`. Same change in `startAndEndLine(in:)`.  
Risk if unfixed: wrong indent/outdent and extra-line side effects in everyday editing.

---

### [P1] `word(at:in:)` traps when the UTF-16 offset is not a `Character` boundary

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/Editor/WordHelpers.swift:7-13, Sources/EditorIntelligence/Editor/Document.swift:56-63  
Symptom: Crash: `Fatal error: String index is out of bounds` (or a silently wrong word) when rename/hover/completion asks for the word at the cursor in a buffer of supplementary-plane characters.  
Repro:

```swift
let text = String(repeating: "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦", count: 10) // 10 Characters, 110 UTF-16 units
_ = word(at: 50, in: text)
```

`50` is inside a cluster (`samePosition` is nil). The fallback does `text.index(startIndex, offsetBy: 50)` in *Character* space; the string only has 10 characters → trap.

```13:13:Sources/EditorIntelligence/Editor/WordHelpers.swift
    let stringIndex = index.samePosition(in: text) ?? text.index(text.startIndex, offsetBy: clampedOffset)
```

`Document.wordAtCursor()` slices a 256-unit window and calls this with a local UTF-16 offset, so a family-emoji (11 UTF-16 units) near the window edge or cursor is enough.  
Fix: If `samePosition` is nil, round to the previous/next `Character` boundary (`index.samePosition` on `utf16.index(before:)` / `after`) and never use `offsetBy:` with a UTF-16 count. Use `offsetBy:limitedBy:`.  
Risk if unfixed: crash on a normal completion/rename path in emoji-heavy files.

---

### [P1] Caret movement and selection changes are treated as document content changes

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/Workspace/Workspace.swift:125-151, 60-63; Sources/EditorIntelligence/Indexing/IndexingService.swift:62-67; Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPWorkspaceSyncBridge.swift:66-71  
Symptom: Every caret move on a non-elided document re-parses the file for the symbol index and sends LSP `textDocument/didChange` with the **full** document. Typing is fine; arrow-key navigation on a large buffer hitch-stutters and LSP servers reset incremental state / re-diagnose.  
Repro:

1. Open a non-file-backed document into a `Workspace` connected to `IndexingService` and `LSPWorkspaceSyncBridge`.
2. Move the caret with the arrow keys (no edit).
3. Observe `IndexingService.indexDocument` and `notifyFullChange` firing twice per move (`selectionChanged` and `cursorMoved`).

Cause: both handlers call `updateDocument`, which always emits `.documentChanged`:

```125:137:Sources/EditorIntelligence/Workspace/Workspace.swift
        case .selectionChanged(let documentID, let selection):
            // ...
                updateDocument(updated)
```

```60:63:Sources/EditorIntelligence/Workspace/Workspace.swift
    public func updateDocument(_ document: Document) {
        openDocuments[document.id] = document
        eventBus.send(.documentChanged(document))
    }
```

Fix: Mutate selection/cursor/viewport in place (or emit a dedicated event) without `documentChanged`. Keep `documentChanged` / `documentEdited` for text mutations only.  
Risk if unfixed: editor jank, LSP diagnostic flicker, wasted CPU.

### [P1] Zero-length regex matches are dropped; `findRanges` can hang

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/FindSearchEngine.swift:324, 398, 123-129; Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/SearchController.swift:51-53; Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/FindSession.swift:234-241  
Symptom: In the find panel, regex `^`, `$`, `\b`, `(foo)?` at a zero-width site, or `a*` on `"bbb"` reports `0/0`. `FindSession.findRanges` with those patterns **never returns**.  
Repro:

1. Find panel, regex on, query `^` in a 10-line file → 0 matches.
2. `try FindSession.findRanges(query: "a*", in: "bbb", matchCase: false, wholeWord: false, useRegex: true)` → infinite loop.

Cause: search skips `range.length > 0`, so line-anchor and word-boundary matches vanish. `findNext` does **not** skip them:

```123:129:Sources/Runestone/TextView/SearchAndReplace/FindSearchEngine.swift
    public static func findNext(...) -> NSRange? {
        // ...
        return regex.firstMatch(in: text, options: [], range: range)?.range
    }
```

`findRanges` then does `location = NSMaxRange(next)` on a `{n, 0}` match and never advances. `FindSearchEngine` also omits `.anchorsMatchLines`, so even a length filter would not match `^` per line (documented, still wrong for a find bar).  
Fix: When a match has length 0, advance the scan cursor by 1 UTF-16 unit (ICU/NSRegularExpression convention). Count and highlight those matches. Add `.anchorsMatchLines` to the find-panel regex options.  
Risk if unfixed: hang in the public API; find/replace of `^`/`$`/`\b` is broken in normal use.

---

### [P1] File-backed grapheme walks use a ±8 UTF-16 window, so ZWJ sequences split

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/PieceTree.swift:355-366  
Symptom: On a mmap-loaded document, Delete/Forward-delete/arrow through `👨‍👩‍👧‍👦` (11 UTF-16 units) or a skin-toned ZWJ sequence leaves a dangling combiner or moves the caret into the middle of the cluster. Untitled/`NSMutableString` buffers are fine because they call `NSString.rangeOfComposedCharacterSequences`.  
Repro:

1. Save a file whose only contents are `👨‍👩‍👧‍👦` and load it with `TextViewState.load`.
2. Place the caret at the start (or just after) and press Delete or Right-arrow.

Cause:

```355:366:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/PieceTree.swift
    func rangeOfComposedCharacterSequence(at location: Int) -> NSRange {
        let capped = min(max(location, 0), max(utf16Length - 1, 0))
        let windowStart = max(0, capped - 8)
        let windowEnd = min(utf16Length, capped + 8)
        // ...
        let composed = (text as NSString).customRangeOfComposedCharacterSequence(at: local)
        return NSRange(location: windowStart + composed.location, length: composed.length)
    }
```

A cluster longer than 8 units to one side of `location` is truncated before Foundation sees it. Family emoji is 11; some flag/ZWJ sequences are longer.

The CRLF helper this calls only looks *backward* from LF, never forward from CR:

```38:45:Sources/Runestone/Library/NSString+Helpers.swift
        let defaultRange = rangeOfComposedCharacterSequences(for: range)
        let candidateCRLFRange = NSRange(location: defaultRange.location - 1, length: 2)
        if candidateCRLFRange.location >= 0 && candidateCRLFRange.upperBound <= length && isCRLFLineEnding(in: candidateCRLFRange) {
            return NSRange(location: defaultRange.location - 1, length: defaultRange.length + 1)
        } else {
            return defaultRange
        }
```

Caret on `\r` of `\r\n` therefore moves/deletes one unit, leaving a lone `\n` (or a caret between CR and LF). Right-arrow from LF coalesces correctly.  
Fix: Grow the piece-tree window until the composed range is stable. When the unit at `location` is CR and the next is LF, return a 2-unit range.  
Risk if unfixed: corrupted clusters, caret stuck inside emoji or between CR and LF.

---

### [P1] Replace Current ignores regex capture groups; Replace All honors them

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Find/FindPanelController.swift:214-219 vs 222-252, 274-278  
Symptom: With regex on, find `(\w+)=(\w+)` and replace `$2=$1`. Replace All swaps the two identifiers. Replace (current match) inserts the literal characters `$2=$1`.  
Repro: Document `a=b`. Regex find `(\w+)=(\w+)`, replace `$2=$1`. Click Replace once.  
Cause: `replaceCurrentMatch` passes `panelView.replaceText` straight into `target.replace`. `replaceAllMatches` runs `ReplacementStringParser` / `parsed.string(byMatching:)`.  
Fix: Build the current match the same way as `FindSearchEngine.replaceAllMatches` (or `SearchController.search(for:replacingMatchesWith:)`), then replace that expanded string.  
Risk if unfixed: wrong edits; users who test with Replace then click Replace All get a different substitution.

---

### [P1] LSP never `didOpen`s file-backed documents, then still sends incremental edits

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPWorkspaceSyncBridge.swift:56-81  
Symptom: Language servers ignore or error on edits to mmap-loaded files (no `textDocument/didOpen`). Diagnostics, completion, and semantic tokens never attach. If the server is lenient, incremental ranges are applied to a document it does not have.  
Repro: Load a file with `WorkbenchDocument.load` (elided snapshot), wire `LSPWorkspaceSyncBridge`, type a character.  
Cause:

```56:81:Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPWorkspaceSyncBridge.swift
        case .documentOpened(let document):
            if document.contentSnapshot.isElided { break }
            // notifyOpened
        case .documentChanged(let document):
            if document.contentSnapshot.isElided { break }
            // notifyFullChange
        case .documentEdited(let document, let edits):
            // no isElided guard — enqueueChange anyway
```

Fix: For elided documents, open with a ranged reader / send full text in chunks, or skip **all** LSP sync (including `documentEdited`) until a non-elided snapshot exists. Do not mix the two.  
Risk if unfixed: intelligence features silently dead on the large-file path.

---

### [P1] LSP `utf16Offset` is filled with the column; several features treat it as a document offset

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPConversion.swift:14-16; Sources/Runestone/EditorIntelligenceAdapter/RunestoneEditorAdapter.swift:61-67; Sources/Runestone/EditorIntelligenceAdapter/TextViewDiagnostic+EditorIntelligence.swift:6-9; Sources/Runestone/EditorIntelligenceAdapter/JumpToDefinitionController.swift:61-65; Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPNavigationProviders.swift:108-114  
Symptom: One conversion bug, several surfaces. Line 10, character 5 becomes document offset 5.

- `EditorAdapter.applyEdit` writes at offset 5.
- LSP diagnostic squiggles appear at the start of the file (column used as `NSRange.location`).
- Go to Definition / Cmd-click (`JumpToDefinitionController.focus`) selects the wrong range. `TextEditApplicator` is the exception: it resolves line/column via `textView.location(at:)`.

Repro: LSP diagnostic on line 10, column 5 of a 200-character file. Squiggle is drawn at UTF-16 offset 5. Jump to a definition on line 20 lands near the top of the file.

Cause:

```14:16:Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPConversion.swift
public func textPosition(from position: LSPPosition) -> TextPosition {
    TextPosition(line: position.line, column: position.character, utf16Offset: position.character)
}
```

```6:9:Sources/Runestone/EditorIntelligenceAdapter/TextViewDiagnostic+EditorIntelligence.swift
        self.init(id: diagnostic.id.uuidString,
                  range: NSRange(location: diagnostic.range.start.utf16Offset,
                                 length: diagnostic.range.end.utf16Offset - diagnostic.range.start.utf16Offset),
```

Fix: Compute a real document offset at conversion time (needs the document), or never read `utf16Offset` for LSP-sourced positions — always go through line/column like `TextEditApplicator`.  
Risk if unfixed: wrong edits, wrong squiggles, wrong navigation. Same root cause; do not "fix" only `applyEdit`.

---

### [P1] Semantic-token deltas are appended instead of applied as LSP edits

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/SemanticTokenStorage.swift:28-36; Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/LSPTypes.swift:161-168  
Symptom: After the first `textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta`, highlighting becomes garbage (tokens on the wrong lines, or a decode of concatenated delta-line numbers).  
Repro: Connect a server that returns `resultId` + deltas (clangd, rust-analyzer). Edit once after the initial full tokens.  
Cause: LSP deltas are `{ start, deleteCount, data }[]` edits against the previous `data` array. This type only stores a flat `data: [UInt32]` and `applyDelta` concatenates it:

```28:35:Sources/EditorIntelligence/LSP/SemanticTokenStorage.swift
    public func applyDelta(_ delta: LSPSemanticTokensDelta) -> [LSPSemanticToken] {
        lock.withLock {
            resultId = delta.resultId
            if !delta.data.isEmpty {
                compressedData.append(contentsOf: delta.data)
                tokens = LSPSemanticTokenDecoder.decode(compressedData)
```

Fix: Model `SemanticTokensDelta.edits` per the spec and apply each edit to `compressedData`. If the client layer cannot get edits, ignore deltas and always request full tokens.  
Risk if unfixed: wrong syntax coloring after the first incremental token response.

---

### [P1] Move-line on a CRLF file can delete a character and leave the caret one unit off

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/MoveLinesService.swift:55-64, 73  
Symptom: In a Windows (CRLF) document whose last line has no trailing newline, moving a block of lines down onto that last line drops the last character of the moved text. The selection after the move is also one UTF-16 unit too far left. LF-only files are fine.  
Repro:

1. Buffer (CRLF): `foo\r\nbar\r\nbaz` with no final newline (`lineEndings == .crlf`).
2. Select the `bar` line and move it down (⌥⌘↓ / `moveSelectedLinesDown`).
3. `bar` becomes `ba`; caret is not on the intended column.

Cause: `delimiterLength` is UTF-16 (2 for CRLF). Swift treats `"\r\n"` as **one** `Character`. `removeLast(2)` therefore removes the CRLF *and* the preceding character. The compensating insert uses `lineEndingSymbol.count` (1) as if it were UTF-16:

```55:64:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/MoveLinesService.swift
        if isMovingDown && targetLine.data.delimiterLength == 0 {
            if lastLine.data.delimiterLength > 0 {
                text.removeLast(lastLine.data.delimiterLength)
            }
            text = lineEndingSymbol + text
            locationOffset += lineEndingSymbol.count
```

Fix: Strip the delimiter with `NSString` / UTF-16 (`text as NSString`).substring, or `removeLast()` once because CRLF is one cluster. Add `(lineEndingSymbol as NSString).length` to `locationOffset`.  
Risk if unfixed: data loss on a normal “move line” in CRLF files.

### [P1] `#eq? @a @b` highlight predicates compare a capture to itself

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/SyntaxHighlighting/Internal/TreeSitter/TreeSitterTextPredicatesEvaluator.swift:60-66  
Symptom: Tree-sitter queries that use `#eq? @capture.a @capture.b` (or `#not-eq?`) always succeed/fail as if both sides were the same capture. Highlights that depend on two captures being equal (e.g. matching XML open/close tags, some JS/TS queries) are wrong.  
Repro: A `highlights.scm` with `(#eq? @open @close)` on a document where the two captures differ. Both sides are looked up with `lhsCaptureIndex`.

```60:66:Sources/Runestone/TextView/SyntaxHighlighting/Internal/TreeSitter/TreeSitterTextPredicatesEvaluator.swift
    func evaluate(using parameters: TreeSitterTextPredicate.CaptureEqualsCaptureParameters) -> Bool {
        guard let lhsCapture = match.capture(forIndex: parameters.lhsCaptureIndex) else {
            return false
        }
        guard let rhsCapture = match.capture(forIndex: parameters.lhsCaptureIndex) else {
            return false
        }
```

`rhsCaptureIndex` is stored and never read.  
Fix: Second lookup must use `parameters.rhsCaptureIndex`.  
Risk if unfixed: wrong syntax coloring for any grammar that uses capture-vs-capture predicates.

### [P1] Expanding an outer fold unhides a still-collapsed inner fold

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Folding/FoldingController.swift:118-128, 274-285  
Symptom: Collapse an inner function, collapse the outer one, expand the outer. Inner body is visible while the inner fold still draws as collapsed. Clicking the inner chevron then *hides* it again (toggle thinks it is expanding from collapsed, so it calls `hide`).  
Repro:

```
func outer() {
    func inner() {
        let x = 1
    }
}
```

Collapse `inner`, collapse `outer`, expand `outer`. `let x = 1` is on screen; inner ribbon is still collapsed.

Cause: `reveal` restores **every** row in the outer range and strips those IDs from `hiddenLineIDs`. It does not re-`hide` nested folds that remain `isCollapsed == true`.

```274:285:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Folding/FoldingController.swift
    private func reveal(_ fold: FoldRange) {
        // ...
        for row in hiddenLineRange where row < lineManager.lineCount {
            let line = lineManager.line(atRow: row)
            hiddenLineIDs.remove(line.id)
            collapsedFoldByHiddenLineID.removeValue(forKey: line.id)
            // ... setHeight to typeset height
        }
```

Fix: After revealing the outer fold, walk nested collapsed children and call `hide` on them (or skip restoring rows that belong to a still-collapsed descendant).  
Risk if unfixed: fold UI lies; a second click on the inner fold hides the body the user just revealed.

### [P1] Timed undo grouping cannot nest, so multi-caret undo also reverts the previous keystroke

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TimedUndoManager.swift:20-34; Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TextInputView.swift:2318-2335, 2282-2294  
Symptom: Type `x`, within one second Option-click a second caret and type `y`. Cmd+Z is supposed to remove both `y`s and restore two carets. It also removes `x` and leaves a single caret.  
Repro: `hello|` → type `x` → Option-click another site → type `y` immediately → Undo.

Cause: `beginUndoGrouping` is a no-op if a group is already open (the 1 s typing group). Multi-caret `insertTextAtAllSelections` then calls `endUndoGrouping()`, which closes that typing group instead of a nested one. Undo replays the multi-caret inverses **and** the `x` inverse. The last undo callback is the single-range typing restore, which overwrites `applySelectedRanges(selectedRangesAfterUndo)`:

```20:34:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/TimedUndoManager.swift
    override func beginUndoGrouping() {
        if !hasOpenGroup {
            super.beginUndoGrouping()
            // ...
        }
    }

    override func endUndoGrouping() {
        cancelTimer()
        if hasOpenGroup {
            super.endUndoGrouping()
        }
    }
```

`moveSelectedLine` already does `end` then `begin` to avoid this; the multi-caret paths do not.  
Fix: Before a multi-caret/batch group, `endUndoGrouping()` (close the typing coalescer) then `beginUndoGrouping()`. Or implement real nested groups.  
Risk if unfixed: undo eats too much and destroys the caret set — normal multi-cursor use.

### [P2] Completion replacement column is computed with `String.count`, not UTF-16

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/Completion/CompletionContextFactory.swift:15-18, 30-42  
Symptom: Completing after a prefix that contains a supplementary-plane identifier (e.g. mathematical bold `𝐀`) produces an LSP range whose `character` is short by 1 per such scalar. `applyCompletion` uses `utf16Offset` so the in-editor replace is fine; anything that consumes `context.range.start.column` (LSP insert/replace, breadcrumbs) is not.  
Repro: Prefix `𝐀foo` (U+1D400 + `foo`). `prefix.count == 4`, UTF-16 length is 5. `column` is decremented by 4.  
Fix: Use `(prefix as NSString).length` (or the already-computed `offset - startOffset`).  
Risk if unfixed: wrong LSP edit range; in-buffer completion still works.

---

### [P2] `textPreview(containing:)` uses `2 * location` instead of `location + length`

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/LayoutManager.swift:262-263  
Symptom: Find-result / highlight previews around a match far into the document are huge or clipped wrong. A match at offset 100 with peek 50 should end near 155; it ends near 250 (`100 + 100 + 50`). A match at offset 0 is truncated (`0 + 0 + peek` instead of `length + peek`).  
Repro: `textView.textPreview(containing: NSRange(location: 100, length: 5))` on a long document; inspect `previewRange`.

```262:263:Sources/Runestone/TextView/Core/LayoutManager.swift
        let startLocation = max(needleRange.location - peekLength, minimumLocation)
        let endLocation = min(needleRange.location + needleRange.location + peekLength, maximumLocation)
```

Fix: `endLocation = min(NSMaxRange(needleRange) + peekLength, maximumLocation)`.  
Risk if unfixed: cosmetic / wrong context in find UI.

---

### [P2] Workspace search line numbers ignore CR / CRLF

Status: CONFIRMED  
Location: Sources/EditorIntelligence/Search/WorkspaceSearchEngine.swift:130-140  
Symptom: Searching a CR- or CRLF-delimited document reports every match as line 0 (or far too small a line). Jump-to-match lands on the wrong row.  
Repro: Open a file saved with `\r\n`, search for a token on line 20.  
Cause: `newlineCount` only tests `== 10` (LF). CR (13) and the CR of CRLF are ignored; CRLF would count 1 if LF is seen, CR-only files count 0.  
Fix: Match the loader (`UTF8DocumentScanner`: LF, CR, CRLF, NEL, LS, PS).  
Risk if unfixed: wrong navigation from workspace search.

## Needs verification

1. **Workbench adapter debounce vs tab switch (single reused `TextView`).** `scheduleContentRefresh` captures `WorkbenchDocument` at edit time and reads `textView` 200 ms later (`RunestoneWorkbenchEditorAdapter.swift:131-137`). `setState` does not fire `textViewDidChange` (`TextInputView.swift:1085-1134`). If a host reuses one `TextView` across tabs, document A can be overwritten with B's text. `EditorHostCache` exists to avoid that; confirm whether MacExample / host apps swap views or call `setState` on one view. Experiment: two files, type in A, switch to B within 200 ms, inspect `A.text` / `A.rangeReader`.

2. **`pendingContentChanges` is adapter-global** (`RunestoneWorkbenchEditorAdapter.swift:19, 194-196`). Multi-pane, one adapter: incremental LSP edits from pane 1 can be attributed to pane 2's document on the next refresh. Experiment: two panes, type in each before the 200 ms debounce fires; inspect `.documentEdited` payloads.

3. **Host save of `WorkbenchDocument.text`.** There is no library save. File-backed docs keep `text == ""`. Any host that writes `document.text` to `url` truncates the file. Experiment: load, type, save via that field, reopen.

4. **Invalid UTF-8 on disk.** `DocumentLoader` throws `invalidEncoding` if `UTF8DocumentScanner` sets `isValid = false`. Confirm the example app surfaces that vs. showing an empty view.

5. **Catastrophic regex.** User-supplied patterns go to `NSRegularExpression` with no timeout (`SearchQuery.swift:72-75`, `FindSearchEngine`). Experiment: `(a+)+$` on a long string of `a`s in the find panel.

6. **Cmd-click go-to-definition uses the caret, not the click.** `JumpToDefinitionController.handleClick` (`JumpToDefinitionController.swift:74-79`) ignores `gesture.location(in:)` and reads `document.cursor.position`. If the click does not move the caret first (gesture on `TextView` vs `TextInputView.mouseDown` order), Cmd-click looks up the wrong symbol. Experiment: caret on line 1, Cmd-click a symbol on line 40.

7. **Tree-sitter `startRow ... endRow` on a stale tree.** `textDidChange` skips `apply(edit)` while a parse is in flight (`TreeSitterInternalLanguageMode.swift:199-208`) while the byte callback reads `stringView` without that lock (`TextInputView.swift:2973-2985`). A later apply can feed `startRow > endRow` (trap) or a huge `endPoint.row` (hang) into `TreeSitterLanguageLayer.swift:127-132`. Experiment: type rapidly during a viewport parse of a large highlighted file.

8. **`FileMapping.remapPages` after failed `mmap`.** Both `MAP_FIXED` attempts can fail (`FileMapping.swift:145-149`); the scan keeps using a pointer over a hole. Experiment: force `mmap` failure (ulimit) while loading a file larger than the remap stride.

9. **Overlapping multi-cursor completion.** `replaceAtAllSelections` does not skip overlaps (`TextInputView.swift:1757-1768`). Experiment: two carets in the same identifier, accept a completion whose range is the whole word.

## Test gaps

1. **File-backed input path never hits `stringView.string`.** Existing `PieceTreeTests` / `DocumentLoaderTests` cover load and substring, not `endOfDocument`, Delete, Find, or `selectAll` after `TextViewState.load`. That is the P0 hang.

2. **Preview-tab reuse with `WorkbenchDocument.load` and with a dirty buffer.** `testTemporaryTabReusesCleanSlot` uses in-memory `"a"`/`"b"` and never sets `isDirty`. No test that `pendingState` survives reuse, or that an edited preview is pinned.

3. **IME undo, nested folds, multi-caret undo grouping, unmatched regex groups, exclusive-end line ranges.** No test that Undo during marked text clears `imeMarkedRange` (the P0 crash). `FoldingControllerTests` never collapse-inner-then-outer-then-expand-outer. Multi-caret tests do not type a character, add a caret within 1 s, type, and Undo. `ParsedReplacementStringTests` misses `{NSNotFound, 0}`. `LineManagerTests` never asserts `lines(in: {0,4})` on `"foo\nbar"`.
