/// Retains one view-hosting instance per key (typically a document ID) across tab switches, so
/// switching between already-open documents doesn't tear down and rebuild the hosted view — losing
/// scroll position, undo history, and syntax-highlight state — every time.
///
/// This exists because `TextView` (and any coordinator/state a consumer wraps around it) is
/// expensive to recreate and stateful in ways that don't survive a rebuild. SwiftUI's
/// `NSViewRepresentable` has no built-in notion of "reuse this specific instance for this
/// document" — its `makeNSView`/`updateNSView` cycle, combined with structural identity churn
/// elsewhere in a view tree (e.g. a sidebar toggling on/off moving a pane to a different position),
/// can tear down and rebuild a hosted view far more often than a consumer wants. Pair with
/// ``EditorHostContainer`` to also survive that structural churn.
///
/// Generic over both the lookup key and the cached host type — a text-editor app might use
/// `EditorHostCache<UUID, MyRunestoneHostView>` keyed by document ID.
///
/// - Important: If a document's `id` gets reused for entirely different content — e.g. a
///   "temporary tab" slot being repointed at a different file while keeping the same identity —
///   call ``remove(_:)`` before the cache is asked for that key again, or a stale cached host will
///   keep showing the old content.
