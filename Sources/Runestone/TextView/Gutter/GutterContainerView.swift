/// view — namely `TextInputView` — which is what lets a text selection drag started in the document
/// continue smoothly as the mouse crosses into the gutter. `hitTest(_:)` on the disabled base
/// `UIView` returns `nil` unconditionally, which stops AppKit's hit-test walk from ever recursing
/// into this view's subviews at all, regardless of their own `isUserInteractionEnabled` — so a
/// child that genuinely needs clicks (the folding ribbon) can't just flip its own flag.
///
/// `interactiveRect` carves out a single exception: when set (to the ribbon's current frame, in
/// this view's own bounds coordinates), points inside it fall through to the normal recursive
/// hit-test instead, letting the ribbon (which stays enabled) claim them, while every other point
/// keeps today's pass-through behavior unchanged.
